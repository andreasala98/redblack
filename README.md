# redblack

This project implements the red-black tree data structure, in particular the method to insert new nodes.
This code was developed for the course _Algorithms and Data Structures_ at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, a.a. 2020-21


## Usage
The repository contains a suite of tests to check if the code works as expected. In order to run the tests, open a Terminal window and (from the redblack folder) run 
```
dotnet test
```
After the test, the interactive program can be executed from the `redblack/main` folder via the command
```
dotnet run
```

## License & Credits
The code is released with the Unlicense (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

I want to thank the authors of the following textbook for writing the pseudocode of the algorithm implemented in this project
